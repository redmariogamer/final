      <h1>What we do</h1>
  
      </div>
      <p>For over 15 years, we have rescued over 5,000 pets around America (and other parts of the world) and brought them to our stores for adoption. We are one of the friendliest and the cleanest pet stores with affordable prices with pets, toys, and other pet related items. If you want to help us, you can check our locations toward which place is convinent and you can either be part of the team or just check out the store to buy our pets. Don't be afraid with any of our pets. We promise that nobody would bite you, not even aggressive dogs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our first location was established in 2010 began in Fremont, California in a small shopping center in the Fremont Hub. We expanded our locations to many places around the Bay Area and all through the United States.</p>
